# Hollicode VS Code language support

A package to add Hollicode syntax highlighting support to VS Code. Being developed alongside the language.

This package adds:
* Hollicode highlighting to `.hlc` files
* Hollicode plain text bytecode highlighting to `.hlct` files. You should never really be editing bytecode by hand, but hey, there you go.

Eventually, I'd like to add compile-on-save functionality, but I've got a lot on my plate right now so that'll happen when it happens.
